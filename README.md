# ObjectDetection

The model training is done in Google Colab
The model is then downloaded and perform object detection locally with the FYP.py

There are 3 parts in the FYP.py,
1. Detect Objects
2. Crop the object detected and classify them into their specific classes
3. Relocated the bounding box of detected objects into the full image to determine if there is any false call or escapee
